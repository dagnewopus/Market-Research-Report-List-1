<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spent Fuel Reprocessing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Fuel Cycle</li><li>Open Fuel Cycle</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spent fuel reprocessing market can be categorized into two main types: closed fuel cycle and open fuel cycle. A closed fuel cycle involves reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to recover usable materials like plutonium and uranium for reuse in reactors, reducing waste and enhancing sustainability. In contrast, an open fuel cycle involves using nuclear fuel only once, with spent fuel stored as waste. The closed cycle is often favored for its efficiency and resource conservation, while the open cycle raises concerns about long-term waste management.</p></p>
