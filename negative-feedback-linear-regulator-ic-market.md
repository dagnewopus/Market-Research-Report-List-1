<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Negative Feedback Linear Regulator IC Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Series Type"</li><li>"Shunt Type"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Negative Feedback Linear Regulator IC market comprises two main types: Series Type and Shunt Type. Series Type regulators control output voltage by varying the resistance in series with the load, providing stable voltage levels and minimal ripple. They are often used in power supplies for sensitive electronic devices. In contrast, Shunt Type regulators maintain the output voltage by diverting excess current away from the load, suitable for low-current applications where precision is critical. Both types are essential for efficient voltage regulation in electronic systems.</p></p>
