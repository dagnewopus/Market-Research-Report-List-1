<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Mass Flow Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal mass flow controllers are categorized into two main types: contact type and non-contact type. Contact type controllers measure mass flow by direct thermal interaction with the fluid, allowing for precise control and measurement but potentially affecting the flow characteristics. In contrast, non-contact type controllers utilize advanced techniques like ultrasonic or infrared sensing to measure flow without physical interaction, leading to reduced wear and tear, making them suitable for sensitive applications. Both types cater to diverse industrial needs.</p></p>
