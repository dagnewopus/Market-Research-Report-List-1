<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antidiabetic Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors</li><li>Biguanides, Sulphonylureas</li><li>Glp-1 Agonist</li><li>Meglitinides</li><li>Dpp-4 Inhibitors</li><li>Sglt-2</li><li>Thiazolodinediones</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The antidiabetic drug market encompasses several types of medications, each targeting diabetes management differently. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors slow carbohydrate absorption; biguanides, like metformin, enhance insulin sensitivity. Sulphonylureas stimulate insulin release, while GLP-1 agonists promote insulin secretion and reduce appetite. Meglitinides also stimulate insulin but have a shorter duration. DPP-4 inhibitors enhance incretin levels to regulate blood sugar, SGLT-2 inhibitors prevent glucose reabsorption in kidneys, and thiazolidinediones improve insulin sensitivity in muscle and fat cells, all contributing to effective diabetes treatment strategies.</p></p>
